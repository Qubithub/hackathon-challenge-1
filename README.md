# Challenge 1 — IBM Quantum Fundamentals Track

Welcome to Challenge 1, provided by IBM Quantum.

Your task is to complete three IBM learning notebooks, document your full solution process, and prepare a short team video explaining your work.
This challenge evaluates both your technical understanding and your ability to communicate your approach clearly.

📘 Required Notebooks
You must complete all exercises inside the following IBM labs:
1. Qiskit Fundamentals Lab 2
– Pauli operators, quantum gates, statevectors, and basic Qiskit primitives.
2.	DiVincenzo Criteria Lab
– Understanding and analyzing the foundational criteria for physical quantum computers.
3.	Single-Qubit Dynamics (SQD) Lab
– Bloch sphere representation, rotations, and single-qubit state evolution.
All exercises must be solved, and code should be clean, reproducible, and well-organized.


📄 Deliverable 1 — Detailed Solution Document (Required)
Upload a PDF or Markdown file inside your IBM_Challenge/ folder explaining how you solved the challenge.

Your document must include:
*	A clear explanation of your approach to each exercise
*	The reasoning behind each step
*	Code snippets and references to key cells
*	Results, plots, or screenshots when needed
*	Problems you encountered and how you resolved them
*	A short conclusion summarizing what you learned

This document is essential — judges will rely heavily on it.

🎥 Deliverable 2 — Team Presentation Video (Required)
Every team must create a 3–5 minute video.

Requirements:
*	All team members must appear and speak (even briefly)
*	Explain how you solved each notebook
*	Show one result or visualization
*	Presentation should be clear and concise

Important:

You must upload the video to Google Drive, not to the repository.

Include a public or viewable Drive link inside your repository:
*	Add it to the README.md, or
*	Create a video_link.txt file

The judges must be able to access it.
